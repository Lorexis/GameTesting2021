Super Mario Bros:
> Correctness: The Mario/Nintendo universe is known for having good and satisfying software that functions well throughout its games.
> Interoperability: The game/games have been transported successfully across different devices + different software to broaden its range.

Minecraft:
> Reuseability: The game has been adapted to run on other platforms and function just as well, if a little differently. I've played the game briefly myself, but seeing the different options for which platform to approach it was interesting.


Angry Birds:
> Flexibility: The software is constantly updated to create new aspects of the game, or just new branches of the game itself.
> Correctness: All the different adaptations of the game come with satisfactory aspects, proving functionality throughout its different versions.
